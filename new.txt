		n-Cubes The n-dimensional hypercube, or n-cube, denoted by Qn , is the graph that has
		vertices representing the 2n bit strings of length n . Two vertices are adjacent if and only if the
		bit strings that they represent di?er in exactly one bit position. The graphs QI , Q2, and Q3 are
		displayed in Figure 6. Note that you can construct the (n + I )-cube Qn+1 fom the n-cube Qn
		by making two copies of Qn , prefacing the labels on the vertices with a 0 in one copy of Qn
		and with a 1 in the other copy of Qn , and adding edges connecting two vertices that have labels
		di?ering only in the frst bit. In Figure 6, Q3 is constructed fom Q2 by drawing two copies
		of Q2 as the top and bottom faces of Q3 , adding 0 at the beginning of the label of each vertex.
